Scripts
=======

This is my collection of scripts that I have available on most servers
I work on.

Most are written by me but sometimes I include useful scripts I
found online.



About the command names
-----------------------

My commands have very long names because most of them I only use from
time to time and I forget their names.

Instead I try to name them in a way that makes tab-completion find the
tool I want easily.

Therefore, the commands start with `x-`.



Dangerous commands
------------------

Without any arguments, no command is dangerous. That is you can run any
command without arguments "to see what it does". If the command is a
filter, it just sits there, waiting for input. Otherwise a short usage
is printed



Author
------

Most commands are written by me, Pedro Melo <melo@simplicidade.org>.

To check the author of a specific command check the script source, or
the AUTHORS file.
