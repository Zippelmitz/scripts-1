# Make sure we have a ssh master process before starting our own ssh
#
# Inspired by http://blog.woobling.org/2010/10/headless-virtualbox.html
#
# Forward configuration is only applied once, on the master process
#
# Suggestion: alias ssh=x-ssh
#
# Example configuration on .ssh/config:
#
#     Host e-stage
#       HostName staging.host.name
#       User melo
#       ForwardAgent yes
#       Compression yes
#       ServerAliveInterval 120
#       ServerAliveCountMax 3 
#       LocalForward 3307 127.0.0.1:3306
#       LocalForward 6380 127.0.0.1:6379
#
# ** YOU ALSO NEED THIS AT THE END OF .ssh/config **
#
#     Host *
#         ControlPath /tmp/ssh-master-control-%r-at-%h-port-%p.sock
#         ClearAllForwardings yes
#
# First time I ssh e-stage, all tunnels are setup; all others ssh e-
# stage reuse the same connection
