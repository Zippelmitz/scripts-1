Usage: <your prove command> | x-test-count

Parses the TAP output and prints the number of ok/not ok test count,
after all the input is spliced to the standard output. Requires
prove to be run with verbose mode on.

Usually prove shows that, but this script will also count subtests.

TODO/SKIP tests are not supported.
